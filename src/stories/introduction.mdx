### System

The {app.name.short} design system is a collection of tokens, styles, and guidelines for creating consistent and accessible user interfaces. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for easy integration into a variety of applications and platforms. The system is primarily driven by [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) and follows the [W3C design tokens specification](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/).

### Components

Components are implementations of the {app.name.short} design system. They are the building blocks of the UI library and toolkit, ready for use in applications.

The components are broken up into the following categories:

- **Core:** UI components used for common patterns and implementations.
- **Typography:** UI components used for text and typography.
- **Layout:** UI components used for page layout and structure.

### Hooks

Hooks, in the context of modern UI libraries and toolkits, are functions that allow "hooking into" component state and lifecycle from within components. They are a way to reuse stateful logic between components.
