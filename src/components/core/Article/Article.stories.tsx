        <h1>The Beauty of Nature</h1>
        <p>
          Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world,

        </p>
        <p>
          From the luscious <code>green forests</code> to the expansive oceans,
          nature offers solace and inspiration. The beautiful sunrise over a
          calm sea or the serene sunset on a warm evening reminds us of the
          wonders of this planet.
